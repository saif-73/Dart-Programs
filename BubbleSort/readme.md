# Name Sorting in Dart

This Dart program sorts a list of names in two ways:

## Features

- **`sortByFirstCharStringList()`**: Sorts names by the first character using **Bubble Sort**.
- **`sortByWholeCharStringList()`**: Sorts names by the full name lexicographically using **Bubble Sort**.

## Main Function

- Calls both sorting functions and prints:
  - One list sorted by the first character.
  - One list sorted by the full name.
